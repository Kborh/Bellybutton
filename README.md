# Bellybutton


The purpose of this project was to identify the top 10 bacteria species, 
and if improbable beef idenfies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef,
the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel 
by clicking their id no. This would allowed for informations on the bar chart to change 
for each individual.
